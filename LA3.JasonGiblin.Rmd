## R Markdown

This is the Lab 3 assaignment for Team R4L.


```{r, message=F, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
source("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/cdc.R")
cdc <- as_tibble(cdc)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=cdc)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = height, y = weight, col=smoke100))

```
The next chunk is a graph of exercise and smoking habits
```{r}
ggplot(cdc)+
  geom_count(mapping = aes(x = exerany, y = smoke100))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
